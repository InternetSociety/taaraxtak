# About the name

taaraxtak (IPA: taːɾaxtak) means "the sky" in the [Chochenyo
Ohlone](https://sogoreate-landtrust.org/lisjan-history-and-territory/) language.

Looking up at the sky, I can only see what's above me. Similarly, the Internet
is something I can only know partially; This name is meant to remind us to look
at what we *can* see, acknowledging its partiality, and being thankful for
whatever we can take from it. (When we measure the Internet we are, in more
senses than one, looking at the shape of clouds). Remember, everything we
learned about the atmosphere started by looking up at the sky. All we ever
need is a partial perspective and an open system of thought.
